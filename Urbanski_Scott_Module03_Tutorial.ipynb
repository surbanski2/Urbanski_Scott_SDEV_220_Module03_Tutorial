    "An init method was created and the \"arr\" parameter was removed from the sorted012 function. This was done in order to make it easy to create a Solution object with testArray as a property that can be applied within the Solution class's sorted012 function. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am aware of a method of sorting arrays that involves repeatedly splitting the array into 2 equal parts, comparing the elements with the parts, and merging them back together as a single array. However, I could not recall exactly how to do that. Instead, I took an approach similar to the middle solution proposed in the Editorial section (the final approach within the Editorial section did not make much sense to me). In my approach I used a dictionary to map out all the distinct array values with their respective frequencies. I then iterated through the initial array a second time assigning values to the array based on the frequency dictionary. However, the frequency dictionary had a problem. Its keys are ordered in the order in which they're entered. This means that, if in the initial array, the unique items do not appear in an ascending order, the \"sorted\" array would have all the unique items grouped together, but they would not be sorted. For example, if the initial array was [1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2], because the first 1 came before the first 0, the sorted array would be [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2] which is not the desired result. This is where the unique array comes in. When iterating through the initial array, if a new item is found, it will be placed into both the frequency dictionary and the unique array. The unique array has logic to sort each of the unique elements, so that when the frequency dictionary is applied, it can be done in the proper order."
